            I have decided to try and make a blender add-on to create a feature that a friend came up with.
            She thought it would be a nice addition and I agreed.
            I learned quickly that there isn't much documentation about creating Blender add-ons.
            I'm using PyCharm for developing the add-on.

        <p>
            The default behaviour for Blender seems to only reload the <strong>__init.py</strong> file and not the sub modules or classes.
            Which means I had to restart Blender every time I made a code change which isn't very optimal.
            I spent 5+ hours trying to figure out how to make the other classes also reload.

Blueprint Line and Shape Traces	you can not trace complex against Skeletal meshes - you will only get the physics asset Doing 36 000 line traces affects performance a bit! Doing 360 capsule traces affects performance a tiny bit.  Location is the location of the sphere when hit, Impact point is the point where the sphere overlapped with the traced object  When doing trace it needs to move a unit, if the distance moved is 0 no hits are returned. Predict projectile path for projectiles if predicting	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LP5shWCnhc
Spline Importing	3ds max script to export spline data ( xyz, tangent in xyz,  tangent out xyz ) and then transform data correctly in unreal engine, the coordinate system between 3ds max and unreal has inverted Y axis, can drag and drop csv files!   blutility to run blueprint functions in editor	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0CeLsI-sr8
Getting Started with Landscapes	Help -> Console Variables -> Open ConsoleHelp.html that has all console commands, "ConsoleCommand ?" - shows an explanation and default value of the written command  Landscape technical guide has really good in depth guide. Lit -> Exposure -> Fixed at Log 0 can fix bright surfaces Ctrl 1 - 3 -> 9? to bind the camera position and rotation to 1 - > 3 Shared Wrap texture setting in material bypasses DX10 and below limitation of max 4 layers per landscape component If you see flickering can try to change ZBounds extension,  flickering is most likely displacement pushed outside component bounds.  To break up tiling there are macro texture variations in starter content as example that adds some random noise, World Composition is for large open worlds	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMKjIZMPJ0Q
Lighting Techniques and Guides	Capsule shadow to have soft shadows in already shadowed area, Scaling meshes can be bad as it stretches the baked lightmaps, Far shadow distance for large landscapes, If doing day/night cycle it's better to turn off light when its under the world  Emissive for static lights require a good lightmap resolution, DumpUnbuiltLightingInteractions lists actors that doesn't have built lighting	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCsrWzt9F28

Destructible Editor Features and Guide	Unreal content level to look at examples with different settings, The mesh has to be a whole mesh or when it fractures it most likely gets holes, Destructible meshes doesn't work on mobile in 4.15 and below, Don't think it works in 4.16 and above.  Editor destructibles has 1 depth whereas externally done through example physXLab has up to 5.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyuvmZvsLdU
Robo Recall Sequencer Cinematics	If building cinematics for VR try and build the scene around the camera. Like in the Robo Recall where everything happens around the player.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUc49HYJeL0
Replication	IsLocallyControlled() can be used to example hide third person mesh for self but not other players  Can use OwnerNoSee in visibility settings instead also, Can add SocketPreview in skeletal mesh editor  Static Mesh replicate movement checkbox, however the server has no idea client has fired a projectile so boxes only moves if server fires gun. To solve the client spawning projectile need a server fire event that spawns the projectile (RPC) . RPC = Remote Procedure Calls   Net Cull Distance decides if the client needs to get the data for that actor or not, Console commands to simulate packet loss and delay	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlDWovBcu7E
Getting Started with Level Streaming	There's a editor content level to showcase the level streaming, WorldComposition for open worlds and streaming levels where you know player is moving	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkDg9GPpzXE
Lighting Techniques and Guides 2: Dynamic Lighting	Distance field (DF) shadows difference in resolution and texture size. If DF self-shadows have artifacts at edges in the Light Source for directional light setting "Ray Start Offset Depth Scale". Or in static mesh editor try to use Distance Field Bias.  Contact shadow is a screen space shadow technique so don't use it alone, IES = Illuminating  Engineering Society ! Can be useful for faking shadows if I understood correctly for performance.   If scene never uses static lighting disable it in rendering settings, Can use World Settings -> Force No Precomputed Lighting for per level setting  In the editor learning resource EffectsCave for cave lighting and particle effect, Can use a hidden low poly mesh to be used for shadows instead of high poly models	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1slxtF_qA

Getting Started with Character Morph Targets	Important to name everything for less confusion! Morph modifier has to be beneath the skin modifier or it gets nullified (in 3ds max I think), ramp up normal map to make characters look old or add wrinkles	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wWGaJL_Q_8
Animation Pose Snapshot	To quickly reset the physics asset without having to reset rotation e.t.c. inside physics editor:  - Hierarchy Bones with bodies  - Collision geometry: Sphere  - Add new body to root bone  - Physics type: Kinematic  - Turn off collisions  - Go to constraints  - For pelvis set linear limits to Free instead of locked   Project download: https://epicgames.box.com/v/TwitchProjectDownload 	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkj6PAbGYtM
Blender to UE4	Trivia! mikktspace = Mikk from Morten S. Mikkelsen,  T space = tangent space Starts by showing off how to smooth groups and smooth artifacts, Hotkeys, many hotkeys :)  If you want to work with meters as scale in blender you need to set Units to meters and then unit scale to 0.01. Also turn off scale when exporting to FBX. It is easier to just do nothing though and keep the FBX scale as 1.0.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDP7GHFtAtE

Baking Materials to Textures 	Guide on unrealengine.com "Render to Texture Blueprint toolset" https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Content/Tools/RenderToTextureTools/Setup/index.html  Convert normal maps from HDR -> 8 bit. For Photoshop:  Open in photoshop -> Image -> Mode -> 8 Bit -> Method -> Exposure and Gamma -> OK !  Convert to world normals to tangent normals in Photoshop:  NVIDIA texture tools -> Alpha Field -> Set to 1.0 -> Alternate Conversions -> Max ( R, G, B ) -> OK  NVIDIA texture tools -> Alternate conversions -> normalize  LOD triangle reduction in percents is handy to quickly reduce triangle count! If using merge actors tool best to put UV coordinates within 0 -> 1 or might get pixelation artifacts or other artifacts when merging. The merge actors puts each actor into their own quadrant for the new UVs,  So better to work in even numbers. For example 3 meshes evenly splits the UV space into 4,  top left for 1 and so on.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaM_owaUpbE
Getting Started with Post Processing	Video starts around ~12.30 , There's a content example for post processing in editor, For depth of field green is close blurring - blue is far blurring.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFT7hFz_DpE

Getting Started with Composure 	Video starts at ~7.30, Composure is a plugin, They used real camera setup to take an IBL cubemap  It's important to use 24 fps film, or to match what you shot the footage as. The end goal of composure is to in real time be able to compose digital assets with real life assets but for now it's only pre-rendered.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIKBHiOIEK0
Depth and Location based effects	Location based opacity using a sphere mask. Used this technique for my game jam entry E For hugs. Willard also demonstrates similar things like using a texture for noise so the effect isn't applied to the whole mesh.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbE0IqbA7w

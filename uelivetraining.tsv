Material & Particles interaction	How to use a material for a particle emitter doing different effects
Blueprint Creating a 2D game 02	Adding taking damage from spikes, blinking and shooting a projectile
Using Material Effects	Displacement stuff to create fireball effects, fancy stuff 
Creating a match 3 game	GameInstance is permanent throughout the whole game from start to finish
Umg inventory drag & drop part 1	Drag & drop
Umg inventory drag & drop part 2	Flip flop,   like a ninja
Umg inventory drag & drop part 3	More drag & drop
Creating a match 3 game part 2	select float based on boolean , gate
Creating a match 3 game part 3	UCLASS adds class to engine for garbage collection e.t.c.,  UGENERATE_BODY adds things like Super::,   TSubClassOf for classes in c++ or blueprint generated classes
controlling effects with blueprint	Map range clamped
Physics based simulation & effects	How to setup collisions, FAT or PAT for skeletal meshes.   Talked about physics too like physics & animation blending.  Also theres a lot of default ue4 levels to load for showcasing effects
Game ready AI part 1	Clamp all the things,   tasks, blackboard, EQS,  blackboard is potentially slow,   They talked about how to stop a character from rotating instantly
Game ready AI part 2	More about AI and then using interfaces
Game frameworks	Went over gameinstance, save& load
Game AI part 3	A struct > 5 arrays, personal perference I guess.   Video was about adding an array of values so they can iterate over it in the AI to see if something is more desirable over something else
Game ready AI part 4	Using an enum as key would be better. Maybe didnt exist back in ue10 though.  -- In Part 9 they go over this topic and says Map doesnt exist in blueprints.
Game ready ai part 5	perception and you can use console to remove debug output somehow :)
Creating Interactions in VR with Motion Controllers 1	Merge actors for performance,  keep UV in 0-1 space,  recalibrate motion controllers possibly
Creating Interactions in VR with Motion Controllers 2	Switches in material can be good but dont overuse it as it creates more shaders, can be easier than having many materials.
Game ready AI part 6	Apple spawning trees!  Or "StamSpawners" as Ian calls em.
Game ready AI part 7 	Sound!  
Game ready AI part 8	Commenting code & changing from array of floats & int to an array with a struct for stats
Creating interactions in VR with motion controllers 3	new vive controllers ( 2016 ) ^^   Overlap events with 3D widgets since they are a 3D object
Blueprint creating a 2D game 03	Added climbing & level selection like mario games on snes
Game ready AI part 9	Added animations, could have used play animation in blackboard but wanted a more generic use case. Also great animation choice! Character falling on its back when it eats an apple.
VR cameras multiplayer, trips and tricks	Ctrl shift . to open profiler,   profile often if doing VR development,  profile often otherwise too just not as often!  Try to leave temporal AA on if you can for VR and optimize other areas first.
C++ tanks vs zombies	Use reimport for assets instead of delete & re-create,  There's a viewport settings in top-left of viewport :O
Blueprint communication	Interfaces doesnt have to be implemented if the function is called nothing happens, introduces streaming levels, Try not to use bind in umg because it happens every frame instead try and bind more performant.
Game ready AI part 10	Moved some AI stuff to c++ and EQS,   From QA: If many AI actors try and use C++ for performance,  if MoveTo doesnt move the actor for a period of time it will fail the MoveTo,  can handle that in blueprint by using a task to check MoveTo result
Blueprint mobile leaderboard, achievements & ads	As title says it's about ads for ios & android, bit of a learning curve setting everything up first time
Custom materials how to use and create metaballs	1) It said meTAballs not meATballs! 2) Custom material is to write hlsl code directly but better not to 99.9% of the time. If doing it then edit consolevariables.ini to get better debug info, Also recommended for good articles: http://www.iquilezles.org/
c++ tanks vs zombies part 2	C++ stuff and then custom rotation & movement code for tank
Exploring sequencer | Future highlight	On working with sequencer live training episode they mentioned a previous stream which was this one where they introduced sequencer!
VR highlights 4.11	A bit about HMD camera and some optimizations and a rendering mode rendering to both cameras at once
game ready ai part 11	Refactored off stream, showed off detour component to make ai not run into each others
blueprint creating a 2D game 04	Improved ladder climbing, hit flicker tied to animation, different weapons and a weapon attached to socket
Moba minions AI part 1	the dragon head default sprite is from 1995 or something! 3 lanes with many waypoints,  to simulate fores between lanes Ian would use a heavily increased pathing cost
Blueprint making a 3D puzzle game	seems like a fun puzzle to do as a project! Spin a cube and click buttons to turn nearby lights on/off
C++ tanks vs zombies part 3	pew pew smoke clouds,  include in cpp files for shorter compile times, will have to look into more! GetSocketLocation returns component location if no socket found
Mastering material instances	talks briefly about best practices with material instances. For example use thumbnails to show what the material instance uses as textures, base color, roughness e.t.c. Never make one massive master material.          Very time consuming to update.          Slow         Takes long to compile         Hard to use translucent & not translucent material   Test test and test again!
Moba minions AI part 2	spawn AI mobs on the lanes, perception component is fast!
New sequencer features	hold ctrl to add item to scene, hold shift to add item as spawnable to sequencer ( not added to level ), cinematic camera has many more film settings than normal camera
C++ tanks vs zombies part 4	learned more about the compiler optimizations! braaaaaains,  zombies that walk until they see tank and then runs
Mesh Displacement & Material Editor	talks about spaces, tangent, object and world space vertex displacement is per vertex world displacement is per pixel wobbly beams!  skeletal displacement doesn't work with world displacement because skeletal is on cpu, world displacement is on gpu 
Moba minion AI part 3	Does ILivable apply to vampires? Draw debug pathing macro to visualize the AI path! project settings -> crowd manager -> max agent radius   if changing an agents avoidance
VR Bow & Arrow	remember to set left & right inside the motion controller! VR bow seems fun!
Get a load of this: how to make a loading screen	none-seamless loading with loadingscreen from room A -> B, level sequence instead of loading screen too, Widget animations!
C++ Plugin based state machine	Use create c++ class menu option also for plugin development!  turing machines, dfa, nfa? Questing system for the state machine, with knights
Canon man tutorial hierarchical instanced static meshes	Canon man, totally not Bomberman! Talk about how unreal engine re-arranges an array internally.instanced meshes culling dithers in & out the meshes.
C++ tanks vs zombies part 5	Tanky zombies! In blueprint editor you can click on the eye next to search bar at variables tab to show "Inherited variables", DeltaTime in tick can be 0 if Tick when paused is enabled. Implementing an interface in c++
Story driven gameplay and cinematics with sequencer	that is one happy orc killing a beast! Can use a cube as root so you can just edit the cube to move subactors like character, camera easily, Curve editing
Particle effect collisions	dampening factor is how rubbery something behaves when colliding, If using scene depth for gpu particles and you dont see the surface particles wont collide, stop collision setting can be used for painting on a surface  distance field if collisions can't use scene depth, has performance concerns though! distance field is per asset and not per instance,   if having 2 collisions for an emitter it uses the last one in emitter list, so if you want 2 types of collisions need to have 2 emitters, attaches 1 emitter to another  EventGenerators for cpu emitters, in this example on collision hit spawn a new emitter, gpu particles doesn't inherit velocity same as cpu particles if spawned  3d sphere mask to move a opacity mask in world space or colormask!
Physical Animations	that is one floppy mannequin! pxvis collision command, They show how to add constraints to a mannequin, Antialiasing post-process doesnt work well with debug lines 
Procedural mesh slicing	If using static mesh for procedurally generated mesh enable CPU access in the mesh, *chop* *chop* *chop*, Ian is abusing the mesh! Ian's laughter at 1:29:05, If using this slicing technique it has to be procedurally meshes, not skeletal meshes e.t.c.
Blueprint drawing to rendertargets overview	Team Liquid won TI7, wieee!  Links from Sam: shaderbits.com/blog/uv-dilation - About dilation and padding with textures. https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/getting-the-most-out-of-noise-in-ue4 - Lots of useful information about noise  Can rightclick a render target to create a static texture, They alter the height of a mesh using rendertarget, Enable Support UV from hit results
C++ Plugin based state machine part 2	Continues with their quest state machine plugin. Can copy array list entries in the editor!  Copy -> Paste,  Shift left click expand arrow expands all children arrows too, Right click to clear output log!
Pawn Movement techniques	Can download the first demod project through editor to see how A* e.t.c is done in blueprint, Player is a magnet to the other pawns (zombies), It gets crazy around 1h 9minutes, those zombies want to eat Ian! Also they cut a skeletal mesh
C++ plugin based state machine part 2	state machine to handle button input for fighting game
Stereo Panoramic Plugin	Link with useful information: https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/capturing-stereoscopic-360-screenshots-videos-movies-unreal-engine-4  Seams at the poles of the rendering can potentially by hidden by black gradient or photoshop content aware, Stereo Panoramic doesn't work for screenspace effects like lightshafts, SSAO or gpu particles
Plugin Based Fighting Game State Machine, Part 4	fistpuncher 2, the work from previous stream comes to fruition with punches, You gotta have a montage!, Project - Maps & Modes - Use Splitscreen local multiplayer
Blueprint Implementing Local Multiplayer	camera pilot mode, ctrl+shift+p, CreatePlayer() - it automatically creates splitscreen, Turn off splitscreen in maps & modes project settings to disable that. There's a steam multiplayer tutorial that goes through setting up steam multiplayer.  Can copy input mappings from 1 DefaultInput.ini to another!
Hierarchical Level of Detail	Is good for reducing drawcalls for a level. Enable hierarchical in world settings - LODSystem, Can re-generate a single cluster to speed up re-building
Cable Component & 4.14 Features	Cable stiffness helps prevent buckle back on itself, Increasing substep time decreases chance of cable ending up in a bad way, The cable doesnt function as a spring so if it's applied to an actor that falls forever the cable gets infinite length 
C++ Tanks vs Zombies part 6	//~ tells tooltip system to ignore that line
World Position Offset Effects	Alan: "He's going to disappear... or get really really big", An erase character material with material erase node, TRON like
Blueprint Line & Shape Traces	you can not trace complex against Skeletal meshes - you will only get the physics asset Doing 36 000 linetraces affects performance a bit! Doing 360 capsule traces affects performance a tiny bit.  Location is the location of the sphere when hit, Impact point is the point where the sphere overlapped with the traced object  When doing trace it needs to move a unit, if the distance moved is 0 no hits are returned. Predict projectile path for projectiles if predicting
Spline Importing	3ds max script to export spline data ( xyz, tanget in xyz,  tanget out xyz ) and then transform data correctly in unreal engine, the coordinate system between 3ds max and unreal has inverted Y axis, can drag & drop csv files!   blutility to run blueprint functions in editor
Getting Started with Landscapes	Help -> Console Variables -> Open ConsoleHelp.html that has all console commands, "ConsoleCommand ?" - shows an explanation and default value of the written command  Landscape technical guide has really good indepth guide. Lit -> Exposure -> Fixed at Log 0 can fix bright surfaces Ctrl 1 - 3 -> 9? to bind the camera position & rotation to 1 - > 3 Shared Wrap texture setting in material bypasses DX10 and below limitation of max 4 layers per landscape component If you see flickering can try to change ZBounds extension,  flickering is most likely displacement pushed outside component bounds.  To break up tiling there are macro texture variations in startercontent as example that adds some random noise, World Composition is for large open worlds
Lighting Techniques & Guides	Capsule shadow to have soft shadows in already shadowed area, Scaling meshes can be bad as it stretches the baked lightmaps, Far shadow distance for large landscapes, If doing day/night cycle it's better to turn off light when its under the world  Emissive for static lights require a good lightmap resolution, DumpUnbuiltLightingInteractions lists actors that doesn't have built lighting
Getting Started with AI	https://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/76972636953/game-development-myths-players-want-smart  Video is a short summary of the Make Game Ready AI series pretty much, Shows how to create a grab animation at ~11m with animation, Redline in behavior tree means failure, white means attempt
Creating Semi Procedural Materials	Has a project assets download link to go through in the editor, Random interiors in windows for buildings e.t.c., Call In editor checkbox for function or event creates a blutility! 
Getting Started with Landscapes Materials and Foliage	Foliage instanced mesh documentation for indepth guide, Select Invalid selects foliage not touching the ground as CLEARLY demonstrated! If landscape lighting isn't looking right try the Use Landscape Lightmap checkbox, Windy tree gone extreme ~44m
Destructible Editor Features & Guide	Unreal content level to look at examples with different settings, The mesh has to be a whole mesh or when it fractures it most likely gets holes, Destructible meshes doesn't work on mobile in 4.15 and below, Don't think it works in 4.16 and above.  Editor destructibles has 1 depth whereas externally done through example physXlab has up to 5.
Robo Recall Sequencer Cinematics	If building cinematics for VR try and build the scene around the camera. Like in the robo recall where everything happens around the player.
Replication	IsLocallyControlled() can be used to example hide third person mesh for self but not other players  Can use OwnerNoSee in visibility settings instead also, Can add SocketPreview in sketal mesh editor  Static Mesh replicate movement checkbox, however the server has no idea client has fired a projectile so boxes only moves if server fires gun. To solve the client spawning projectile need a server fire event that spawns the projectile (RPC) . RPC = Remote Procedure Calls   Net Cull Distance decides if the client needs to get the data for that actor or not, Console commands to simulate packet loss and delay
Getting Started with Level Streaming	There's a editor content level to showcase the level streaming, WorldComposition for open worlds and streaming levels where you know player is moving
Lighting Techniques and Guides 2: Dynamic Lighting	Distance field (DF) shadows difference in resolution and texture size. If DF self-shadows have artifacts at edges in the Light Source for directional light setting "Ray Start Offset Depth Scale". Or in static mesh editor try to use Distance Field Bias.  Contact shadow is a screenspace shadow technique so don't use it alone, IES = Illimunating Engineering Society ! Can be useful for faking shadows if I understood correctly for performance.   If scene never uses static lighting disable it in rendering settings, Can use World Settings -> Force No Precomputed Lighting for per level setting  In the editor learning resource EffectsCave for cave lighting & particle effect, Can use a hidden lowpoly mesh to be used for shadows instead of highpoly models
Getting Started with World Composition	They use World Machine software to make the heightmaps,
Getting Started with C++	Goes through UProperty and basic c++ things, 0.5 is a double by default, 0.5f is a float,  CDO =  class default object that all other classse will copy from when engine starts
Getting Started in VR	When learning VR learning resources:   * Showdown VR Demo ( Learn Tab Demo )  * Nvidia VR Fun House  ( Modding Launcher Tab ) * Robo Recall ( Modding Launcher Tab, oculus exclusive)  Ocular Vestibular Mismatch = VR Sickness! VR editor is cool
Realtime Simulation and Volume Modelling Plugin	Happy face cloud, Pressure Diviser to at least 2 for performance, Useful for simulating and then render to a texture, [unroll] on loops in shader code for more accurate shader complexity when using loops
Getting Started with Character Morph Targets	Important to name everything for less confusion! Morph modifier has to be beneath the skin modifier or it gets nullified (in 3ds max I think), ramp up normal map to make characters look old or add wrinkles
Animation Pose Snapshot	To quickly reset the physics asset without having to reset rotation e.t.c. inside physics editor:  - Hierarchy Bones with bodies  - Collision geometry: Sphere  - Add new body to root bone  - Physics type: Kinematic  - Turn off collisions  - Go to constraints  - For pelvis set linear limits to Free instead of locked   Project download: https://epicgames.box.com/v/TwitchProjectDownload 
Blender to UE4	Trivia! mikktspace = Mikk from Morten Mikkelsen,  T = tangent space Starts by showing off how to smooth groups and smooth artifacts, Hotkeys, many hotkeys :)  If you want to work with meters as scale in blender you need to set Units to meters and then unit scale to 0.01. Also turn off scale when exporting to FBX. It is easier to just do nothing though and keep the FBX scale as 1.0.
Saving and Loading	Theres no functionality that they know off to "cheat proof" a save game by obfuscating the data. 
C++ Q&A	AddDebugMessageToScreen(key, ... ) the key is an index and will overwrite the same message if it's not -1, If copy-pasting code from internet, copy-paste everything! 
Baking Materials to Textures 	Guide on unrealengine.com "Render to Texture Blueprint toolset", Nvidia Texture Tools for Adobe Photoshop    Convert normal maps from HDR -> 8 bit. For photoshop:  Open in photoshop -> Image -> Mode -> 8 Bit -> Method -> Exposure and Gamma -> OK !  Convert to world normals to tangent normals in photoshop:  Nvidia texture tools -> Alpha Field -> Set to 1.0 -> Alternate Conversions -> Max ( R, G, B ) -> OK  Nvidia texture tools -> Alternate conversons -> normalize  LOD triangle reduction in percents is handy to quickly reduce triangle count! If using merge actors tool best to put UV coordinates within 0 -> 1 or might get pixelation artifacts or other artifacts when merging. The merge actors puts each actor into their own quadrant for the new UVs,  So better to work in even numbers. For example 3 meshes evenly splits the UV space into 4,  top left for 1 and so on.
Getting Started with Post Processing	Video starts around ~12.30 , There's a content example for post processing in editor, For depth of field green is close blurring - blue is far blurring.
Getting Started with Gameplay Programming	Video starts at ~5.55, is about creating a custom camera that smoothly follows player, preprocessor #if !UE_BUILD_SHIPPING
Getting Started with Composure 	Video starts at ~7.30, Composure is a plugin, They used real camera setup to take an IBL cubemap  It's important to use 24 fps film, or to match what you shot the footage as. The end goal of compusure is to in realtime be able to compose digital assets with real life assets but for now it's only pre-rendered.

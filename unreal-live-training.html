    I watched all unreal engine live training youtube videos by epic games to try and get a broader understanding of the engine and other miscellanous 3D concepts.
    I took notes from each video on what I learned or key parts of the video.

            Introduction
        </h1>
        <p>
            I've been wanting to learn unreal engine for quite some time and first time I briefly touched the engine was in 2015 with version 4.7.
            Where I tinkered with the engine for maybe 60 hours in total.
            I did also touch UDK back in ~2012 but never got very far with unrealscript.
            But now in May 2017 I decided to give it another go and came across a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/unrealengine">live training stream</a> Epic has been running about once a week for few years now.            
            The videos I watched are saved to youtube in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlv_N0_O1ga0aV9jVqJgog0VWz1cLL5f">youtube playlist.</a>            
            I decided to try and watch all of the videos to better learn about the engine and other concepts I might never have heard about before.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to watch 1 video a day and started around 8th of May and finished on September the 16th.
            Watching videos with 1.25x speed saves a lot of hours :).
            I think I saved about 40 hours by using 1.25x speed over 100 videos.
            Some videos were far more interesting than others but for example most of the things Alan Willard did with materials using displacement or world offsets were quite cool.
            I also did not always watch the videos with 100% focus as not everything was super interesting to me or I already knew a fair bit about the subject.
            Videos about VR became a history timeline about Oculus, Samsung Gear VR and eventually Vive.
        </p>
        <p>
            The notes I took was mainly for myself incase I need to search on an issue to find a possible video touching on the subject.
            However I figured that these notes could serve as a secondary overview and thus decided to write this blogpost.
            Also I wrote a C# console application to parse the CSV file into HTML output because editing 90 rows by hand would have been quite cumbersome task! :)

                dampening factor is how rubbery something behaves when colliding, If using scene depth for gpu particles and you dont see the surface particles wont collide, stop collision setting can be used for painting on a surface  distance field if collisions can't use scene depth, has performance concerns though! distance field is per asset and not per instance,   if having 2 collisions for an emitter it uses the last one in emitter list, so if you want 2 types of collisions need to have 2 emitters, attaches 1 emitter to another  EventGenerators for cpu emitters, in this example on collision hit spawn a new emitter, gpu particles doesn't inherit velocity same as cpu particles if spawned  3d sphere mask to move a opacity mask in world space or colormask!

Convert to world normals to tangent normals in photoshop:  Nvidia texture tools -> Alpha Field -> Set to 1.0 -> Alternate Conversions -> Max ( R, G, B ) -> OK  Nvidia texture tools -> Alternate conversons -> normalize  LOD triangle reduction in percents is handy to quickly reduce triangle count! If using merge actors tool best to put UV coordinates within 0 -> 1 or might get pixelation artifacts or other artifacts when merging. The merge actors puts each actor into their own quadrant for the new UVs,  So better to work in even numbers. For example 3 meshes evenly splits the UV space into 4,  top left for 1 and so on.
